## Developer Certificate of Origin

We require that all contributors sign off on their commits. This certifies that you created the contribution or have the right to submit it under the project's license.

### How to Sign Off

Add the `--signoff` (or `-s`) flag when committing:

```bash
git commit -s -m "Your commit message"
```

This automatically adds a sign-off line to your commit message:
```
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
```

**Important**: Pull requests with unsigned commits will not be accepted.
