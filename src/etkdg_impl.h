/**
 * @brief Tracks conformer generation results and dispatches molecule IDs for processing
 *
 * Provides a batch of molecule IDs for the next round of conformer generation attempt. First, loops over all molecules,
 * and sequentially assigns molecules that are not yet at their target conformer count and have not exceeded the max
 * iterations threshold. Each molecule will be assigned up to `numConfsPerMol` conformers, either in one batch or
 * distributed over several. If a molecule has already reached its target conformer count, it will not be included in
 * the batch.
 *
 * Once all molecules have had at least n_conformers dispatched, the scheduler will loop back to the first molecule and
 * start oversubscribing, but will only add the number of unfinished remaining conformers to start. See unit tests for
 * examples of this behavior.
 *
 * Thread-safe operations.
 *
 * TODO:
 * For a given unique molecule, ETKDG attempts N conformers with M max iterations per conformer. We approximate this
 * with N X M total attempts per unique molecule, noting that this is not strictly the same as the above case, as if
 * a molecule attempt succeeds before max attempts, the extra attempts are added on at the end.
