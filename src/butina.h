/**
 * @brief Perform Butina clustering on a distance matrix with automatic thresholding.
 *
 * This is a convenience wrapper that converts the distance matrix into a binary hit
 * matrix by thresholding at the specified cutoff, then performs Butina clustering.
 * The Butina algorithm is a deterministic clustering method that iteratively selects
 * the item with the most unclustered neighbors and forms clusters.
 *
 *
 * @param distanceMatrix Square distance matrix of size NxN where distanceMatrix[i*N+j]
 *                       contains the distance between items i and j.
 * @param clusters Output array of size N. Each element will contain the cluster ID for
 *                 that item. Modified in-place.
 * @param cutoff Distance threshold for clustering. Items with distance < cutoff are
 *               considered neighbors.
 * @param neighborlistMaxSize Maximum size of the neighborlist used for small cluster optimization.
 *                            Must be 8, 16, 24, 32, 64, or 128. Larger values allow parallel
 *                            processing of larger clusters but use more memory.
 * @param stream CUDA stream to execute operations on. Defaults to stream 0.
