### Features
- Add memory-segmented cross-similarity code, enabling larger datasets on systems with limited GPU memory ([#13](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Digital-Bio/nvMolKit/pull/13))
- Support conformer deduplication in ETKDG conformer generation ([#14](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Digital-Bio/nvMolKit/pull/14))
- Allow molecules > 256 atoms in conformer generation and MMFF optimization ([#16](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Digital-Bio/nvMolKit/pull/16))
- Enable all combinations of (ET)(K)(DG) in conformer generator ([#17](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Digital-Bio/nvMolKit/pull/17))

### Bug Fixes
- Fix compilation error on C++ build with target=native on Hopper architecture GPUs. ([#6](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Digital-Bio/nvMolKit/pull/6))
- Fix lack of device-set cleanup in multi-GPU code ([#8](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Digital-Bio/nvMolKit/pull/8))
- Fix bug in fingerprint bool->bitfield packing/unpacking code ([#11](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Digital-Bio/nvMolKit/pull/11))
- Fix integer overflow leading to incorrect allocations in similarity calculation code. ([#20](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Digital-Bio/nvMolKit/pull/20))
- Fix crash in most multithreaded APIs whenever exceptions are thrown inside of OpenMP loop. Exceptions now properly propagated to python ([#18](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Digital-Bio/nvMolKit/pull/18))

### Miscellaneous
- Removed unsupported Bulk Similarity APIs ([#12](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Digital-Bio/nvMolKit/pull/12))
